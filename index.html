        <h2> <span class ="name"> Elon Musk</span> on Dogecoin Improvements, Shiba Inu Token</h2>
        

        <p>Tesla and Spacex CEO <span class ="name"> Elon Musk</span> made several tweets about cryptocurrency, bitcoin, dogecoin, and the shiba inu token Sunday.
            Regarding Dogecoin’s improvements, he was <span class="verb">asked</span> whether he had any recent interactions with the Doge development team. While admitting that he had not interacted with them lately, Musk shared:</p>

        <p>Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus chimed in and responded to Musk’s Doge improvement tweet. He stressed that in his opinion, “dogecoin being <span class="adjective">fast</span>, <span class="adjective">scalable</span>, and <span class="adjective">inexpensive</span> to send around is all it needs to be,” adding that “it doesn’t need to be yet another blockchain that hosts NFTs or other tokens or whatever.” Musk <span class="verb">replied</span> with a “hundred points” symbol.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, Musk responded to another Doge supporter who <span class="verb">asked</span>: “Do you think if Dogecoin accomplishes the goals you put forth here then it could be more practical and <span class="adjective"> efficient</span> than something like the <span class="adjective">Lightning</span> Network as a medium of exchange?”
            The Tesla executive <span class="verb">answered</span>: “Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth & high latency. If both continue to improve substantially, we will reach a point when no second layer is needed.”
            In August, Musk agreed with the billionaire owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, that “The community for doge is the <span class="adjective">strongest</span> when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.”
            Musk also <span class="verb">clarified</span> Sunday that he does not have anything to do with the Dogecoin Foundation in response to a comment on Twitter stating: “<span class ="name"> Jared Birchall</span> represents <span class ="name"> Elon Musk</span>, but as all advisors he has no direct voting rights. This guarantees the foundation stays 
            independent while taking advantage of the expertise of shibes like <span class ="name"> Elon</span>.” The Spacex CEO <span class="verb">wrote</span>:
            "Neither Jared, nor me, nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation.""
            The Dogecoin Foundation relaunched in August. Its website lists <span class ="name"> Jared Birchall</span> as one of its four board advisors, describing him as a “legal & financial advisor” to Musk. Other board advisors include Markus and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin.
